			/*APPROACH #4 - Best approach
			This is ideal because we don't have any more loops which also means we don't
			need to store a handler on every element. This would be very beneficial if we had 1,000
			buttons. 

			We are taking advantage of events bubbling and the idea of event delegation. 
			Delegated events - events that are attached to a parent element, but only get executed
			when the target of the event matches some criteria

				console.log("target", e.target);
				console.log("currentTarget", e.currentTarget);
				/*we use target here because target is the actual target of the event. Where the event is trying to get
				to or where it came from in the DOM. In other words the target is the element that triggers the event.
				currentTarget, on the other hand, is the element that is currently handling the event. In this case the
				currentTarget would be the UL.toolbar.

			 	if(!button.classList.contains("active"))
			    	button.classList.add("active");
			  	else
			    	button.classList.remove("active");
			});



			/*APPROACH #3 - Works correctly but not ideal
			We can use the currentTarge property on event object, e, so we don't need to use a closure
			to store the correct reference to the button variable. We can simply look at which target
			was clicked.

			This approach is much better than #2 but what if we had 1,000 buttons? We would be storing a callback
			function on each element. Which will work, but there's actually a better solution in #4 where
			we only need to attach one handler. 
			
			var toolbarButtonHandler = function(e) {
				//e.currentTarget is the element that is currently being processed
				//as the event capturing and bubbling occurs, this value changes
				var button = e.currentTarget;
				if(!button.classList.contains("active"))
					button.classList.add("active");
				else
					button.classList.remove("active");
			};

			for(var i = 0; i < buttons.length; i++) {
			 	buttons[i].addEventListener("click", toolbarButtonHandler);
			}
			*/


			/*APPROACH #2 - Works correctly but not ideal
			We use the idea of a closure here in order to have the button variable correctly point
			at the element we intended. 
			Because the addOrRemoveActive function returned will still have access to the variables defined outside of it
			when the function is declared (in this case the parameter 'button'), when addOrRemoveActive is called it will point 
			the value of 'button' when it was defined. 
			To illustrate this, we've created a time stamp stored in a variable each time createToolbarButtonHanlder is called
			The variable 'time' is created again each time the function is called and therefore stores a different value each time.
			Similarly 'button' is created each time createToolbarButtonHandler and therefore store as unique value each time.
			
			This approach works but we have to create a separte inner function in order to preserver the scope for 'button'

			var createToolbarButtonHandler = function(button) {
			  function addOrRemoveActive() {
			  	var currentTime = = new Date().getMilliseconds();
			  	console.log("stored time is ", time);

			    if(!button.classList.contains("active"))
			      button.classList.add("active");
			    else
			      button.classList.remove("active");
			  };

			  var time = new Date().getMilliseconds();
			  console.log("time at declaration", time);

			  return addOrRemoveActive;
			};

			for(var i = 0; i < buttons.length; i++) {
			  buttons[i].addEventListener("click", createToolbarButtonHandler(buttons[i]));
			}
			*/

			/*APPROACH #1 - Incorrect
			Problem is that button keeps getting reassigned at the start of every iteration of the loop
			When the loop starts, it correctly adds a listener on to the first button element, Pencil
			But when i is incremented to 1, button is reassigned to Pen. Pen has a listener correctly added
			but when a user clicks on Pencil now, the variable 'button' is now pointing at Pen, so the code
			will end up adding the "active" class to the Pen element. 
			At the end of the loop, the variable button is left pointing at the Eraser element. So even though
			all elements correctly have listeners added to them, when a user clicks on them and the handler is 
			triggered, button will point to Eraser so the "active" class will always get added to Eraser.
			
			for(var i = 0; i < buttons.length; i++) {
			  var button = buttons[i];
			  button.addEventListener("click", function() {
			  	console.log("button", button.innerHTML,"was clicked"); //will always say "button Eraser was clicked"
			    if(!button.classList.contains("active"))
			      button.classList.add("active");
			    else
			      button.classList.remove("active");
			  });
