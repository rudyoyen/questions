### What does a doctype do?

It is a declaration (not a tag like `<div>`) that tells the browser which standard of HTML or XML to follow. 
If you use `<!DOCTYPE html>`, this will tell the browser to use full standards mode of HTML5. If you serve your page as XHTML using the "application/xhtml+xml" MIME type as the content-type in the respone header, you do not need a doctype. 
According to the XHTML1 standard,  you could use XHTML by declaring a special DOCTYPE. However, no browsers have ever implemented this, and the HTML5 standard has reversed the decision. If your page is sent as text/html, you are not using XHTML.
Instead, the proper MIME type must be present in the Content-Type HTTP header. If you only put the MIME type into an HTML meta tag like `<meta http-equiv=â€¦>`, it will be ignored and treated like text/html

### What's the difference between full standards mode, almost standards mode and quirks mode?

These are the three modes used by the layout engines in web browsers. The difference modes are determined by the doctype declaration at the top of the mark up page.
Quirks mode - emulates nonstandard behavior in Navigator 4 and IE5. This is necessary to support websites that were built
before the adoption of web standards.
Full standards mode - the web page has the behavior as described in the HTML5 and CSS3 specficiations
Almost standards mode - only a small number of quirks are implemented


### BD Question - What is the purpose of `<meta charset="utf-8">`?
	
It tells the browser what type of character encoding the content should be read in. A character set is a group
of characters. Character sets are stored in computers and each character is mapped to a unique key. This mapping
is what is called character encoding. So, when you input text using a keyboard or in some other way, the character 
encoding maps characters you choose to specific bytes in computer memory, and then to display the text it reads 
the bytes back into characters.

UTF-8 is a unicode-based encoding. There are three different types of character encodings, UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32, 
only UTF-8 should be used for the web. We want to use Unicode becasue it can support many languages and can accommodate
pages and forms in a mixture of those languages. It also eliminates the need for server-side logic to individually 
determine the character encoding of each incoming form submission. 


### BD Question - What does the browser do when it encounters a script tag? (Parser Blocking)
	
When the browser encounters a script tag (ie `<script>` for a JS file), it stops parsing the HTML and executes the contents of the script first. Once finished, it continues parsing the HTML to build the DOM. This is known as "Parser Blocking".

NOTE, the default nature is for it to stop parsing regardless of whether the script is inline or if it references an external source. 
Example of inline script:

	<script>
		var greeting = "hello";
	</script>

Example of script with external reference:

	<script src="my.js"></script>

There is a slight difference between the two, however. Although parsing is paused in both scenarios, when the browser comes to a script withan exernal source, the browser also must pause and wait for the script to be fetched from the disk, cache, or a remote server which can add tens to thousands of miliseconds of delay to the critical path rendering. The browswer pauses parsing the HTML when it encounters a script because the browser doesn't know whether the JS will have any impact on the DOM so it assumes worst case scenario to be safe - that is does impact the DOM.

If you don't want it to block the parsing, you need to specify in the script tag as an attribute 'async':

	<script async src="my.js">

Adding the async keyword to the script tag will tell the browser to continue constructing the DOM while the contents of the script are fetched. NOTE, this only works if the script has an external reference. Adding async to a an inline script will have no effect. 
BD NOTE - I assume this means the async keyword only allows the fetching of the content to happen asynchronously but the execution of the contents of the JS file will still pause the DOM construction. 

Another option is `<script defer>`. This defers the execution of the script until the HTML is parsed all other resources are loaded but before DOMContentLoaded is fired. The benefit would be that the visible content loads faster but there are reports that the defer behaves differently in different browsers and is not completely reliable. 


### BD Question - What does the browser do when it encounters a style tag? (Render Blocking)

When the browser encounters a style tag (ie `<style>` for a CSS file), it stops any script execution or DOM construction until 
is has finished downloading the CSS and constructing the CSSOM (CSS Object Model). 

	
### What's the difference between HTML and XHTML?

HTML can travel over the network to a browser either in HTML syntax or an XML syntax called XHTML. In the reponse header on a message sent from server to client or client to server, the content-type (MIME type) for HTML is "text/html" and for XHTML it is "application/xml+html".

XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. It is a generic markup language specified by W3C and used in IT industry.
XML tags resemble HTML tags but XML is much more flexible because users can define their own tags so it is more
like a meta-language.
XHTML is a stricter (than HTML) XML-like syntax


### Are there any problems with serving pages as application/xhtml+xml?

Internet Explorer 8 and older browsers instead show a download dialog box for unknown file types when they see an XHTML document with the correct XHTML MIME type. Also be aware that many popular JavaScript libraries and developer tools have limited or no support for XHTML.

### What are data- attributes good for?
	
They allow you as the developer to append propriety information to HTML elements that are not visible to the end user. You can store information about element like you would store properties on a JavaScript object. You can also access them in CSS and define CSS styles based on the value of a data attribute. Knockout uses data-bind and ScaleJS created data-class which are custom bindings to HTML elements. One thing to note though, is that the performance of reading data-attributes compared to storing data in JS objects is poor. 


### Consider HTML5 as an open web platform. What are the building blocks of HTML5?

* Video and audio elements (no longer need Flash, Silverlight, etc)
* Input type attributes (ie datetime shows a calendar)
* Canvas element and SVG
* Semantic markup (header, footer, section, summary)
* JavaScript API
* Geolocation API
* Web Worker API
* Data storage (sessionStorage and localStorage)


### Describe the difference between a cookie, sessionStorage and localStorage.

Cookie - A small piece of data that the server sends to the browser. The browser may store it and send it back together with the next request to the same server. It's mainly used to know if two requests came from the same browser to rememebr stateful information in a stateless HTTP protocol. Examples of cookies:
* session management (user logins, shopping carts)
* personalization (user preferences)
* tracking (analyzing user behavior)

Since cookies are sent along with every request, they should not be used for general storage as it will have an impact on performance. For general storage, sessionStorage and localStorage should be used. A max of 4KB can be stored in a cookie.

sessionStorage and localStorage are very similar except:
 sessionStorage gets cleared when the page session ends (either tab is closed or window is closed). The sessionStorage does not get cleared on a reload or even if you navigate away from that page and then back to it as long as the tab or window isn't closed. Opening a page in a new tab or window will cause the new session to be initiated - This is different than how a cookie works.
 localStorage never gets cleared unless the user decides to delet it.

Example of localStorage:
* store data locally that takes a long time to retrieve from the server. You will have to wait the first time, but subsequent views of the page will not have to wait.
* save state of an app without requiring a user to log in

Be careful of security cocerns with localStorage and sessionStorage. You could log off of a website but still have sensitive info stored in sessionStorage or localStorage.


### What is progressive rendering?

The browser should display whatever content it has as soon as possible.


### BD Question - What's the benefit of a CDN (Content Delivery Network)?
	
Performance - Content can be cached or pre-saved on CDN servers closest to the client making the request. This can greatly reduce the load time if the origin server is located much farther away (other side of the world) compared to a close CDN server (same city).
If the content is not cached, the request can travel a lot faster traversing the network of CDN servers.

Availability - Having a distributed network also allows delivery of content on a consistent basis even at peak traffic times. Without CDN, all the traffic has to be absorbed by the provider's origin infrastructure. 


### Describe the difference between `<script>`, `<script async>` and `<script defer>`.

Question answered above regarding script loading.

### Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS `<link>`s between `<head></head>` and JS `<script>`s just before `</body>`? Do you know any exceptions?
	
This prevents FOUC (flash of unstyled content). By placing link tags in the head it improves page load times and avoids the browser 
having to repaint the page when later stylesheets are downloaded (which was what causes FOUC).
