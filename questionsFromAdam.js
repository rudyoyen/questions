// > Phone Screen Questions:
// > 1.) Given a list of words, remove the duplicates from the list
// > 2.) Imagine a sorted array of values, then rotate that array (eg, 1 2 3 4 becomes 3 4 1 2). How would you search inside that array?
// > 3.) Imagine you're getting a stream of nodes. Each node gives you the node ID and it's parent ID. Write an function that can take this stream and build the graph.
// > 4.) You're building a front end server. Each backend server can only handle a single request every 10 seconds (although it can still handle requests in parallel). Design/Code the front end server to distribute requests to the backend.

// > 2.) Design cron
// > 3.) Pretend you have a magic 8 ball that gives you the prices of a stock for the next 7 days (eg. $200, $50, $300, $301). Design the algorithm that will choose the best day to buy and sell the stock to maximise profit (eg. $50 and $301 in the above example).
// > 4.) Design a way to distribute 100TB of data to certain data centers.
// > 5.) Given an array of building objects (each has a start location, end location and height member field), design a way to trace the city sky-line.
// > 6.) Describe what happens when you navigate to google.com
// > 7.) Write an iterator for a non-binary tree.

// > 4.) Given an array number (all of which are within 0 and 1000) return all the primes
// > 5.) Merge two sorted linked lists
